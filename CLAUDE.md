```

## Architecture

### Page Structure

```
/                        → Main landing page (PageWrapper)

### Component Hierarchy

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `PageWrapper.tsx` | Main page orchestrator, modal state management |
| `app/skin-assessment/page.tsx` | Standalone multi-step assessment with scoring |
| `app/suitability-check/page.tsx` | Safety screening with declaration system |
| `BookingModal.tsx` | Booking form with optional assessment integration |
| `StructuredData.tsx` | JSON-LD LocalBusiness schema for SEO |
| `FacebookPixel.tsx` | Meta Pixel tracking with custom events |
| `ScrollToTop.tsx` | Disables browser scroll restoration, scrolls to top on navigation |
| `Footer.tsx` | Contact details, links, legal |

### Fat Reduction Callout

The main landing page focuses on skin tightening (post-Ozempic). A subtle callout below the AssessmentTool in `PageWrapper.tsx` redirects visitors interested in fat reduction to `/skin-assessment`, which has branching logic for different goals including "Stubborn fat I can't shift".

## Assessment System (Key Feature)

### Branching Logic

The assessment uses a `showWhen` conditional system for dynamic question paths:

```typescript
{
  id: 'stubbornFat_duration',
  question: 'How long have you struggled with stubborn fat?',
  showWhen: (answers) => answers.primaryGoal === 'stubbornFat',
  options: [...]
}
```

**Primary Goal Branches:**
- `stubbornFat` → Fat-specific questions
- `looseSkin` → Skin laxity questions (includes Ozempic/weight loss)
- `both` → Combined questions
- `toneUp` → Event preparation questions
- `postPregnancy` → Post-baby body questions

### Scoring Algorithm

Located in `calculateSuitability()` function. Scores based on:
- Lifestyle factors (exercise, water, sleep, stress)
- Skin elasticity
- Treatment timeline urgency
- Budget readiness
- Previous treatment history

**Score Tiers:**
- 80+ = Excellent candidate
- 60-79 = Good candidate
- 40-59 = Moderate candidate
- <40 = May need consultation

### Webhook Payload

Sends to GHL (GoHighLevel) with formatted notes field:

```json
{
  "firstName": "Jane",
  "email": "jane@example.com",
  "phone": "07700900000",
  "bestTimeToContact": "Morning",
  "primaryGoal": "Stubborn fat I cannot shift",
  "suitabilityScore": "Excellent",
  "suitabilityPoints": 85,
  "recommendation": "Consultation + First Treatment",
  "recommendedPrice": "£50",
  "recommendedSessions": "Personalised plan",
  "notes": "━━━ FORMATTED SUMMARY ━━━",
  "source": "body-assessment-landing",
  "assessmentVersion": "4.2"
}
```

## Suitability Check / Contraindications

### Categories

The suitability check categorizes conditions into three response types:

| Category | Conditions | Response |
|----------|------------|----------|
| **Temporary** | Pregnancy, recent surgery, cosmetic procedures, skin issues | "Almost there" - can proceed when resolved |
| **Consultation** | Autoimmune, diabetes, cardiovascular | "Let's chat" - needs clinic discussion |
| **Not Suitable** | Cancer, pacemaker/implants, epilepsy, keloid, under 18 | Firm contraindication |

### Declaration System

After completing the check, users can send a declaration via:
- **WhatsApp** - Pre-filled message with conditions acknowledged
- **Email** - Formatted declaration to clinic email

This creates a record of informed consent before treatment.

## Configuration Points

### Must Change for New Clinic

```
app/layout.tsx              → Metadata, business name, domain
app/skin-assessment/page.tsx → CONFIG object (webhook URL, phone numbers)
app/suitability-check/page.tsx → CONFIG object (phone, email)
components/Footer.tsx        → Contact details, address
components/StructuredData.tsx → LocalBusiness schema
public/images/              → Logo, practitioner photos, results
```

### CONFIG Objects

Each page with external integrations has a CONFIG object at the top:

```typescript
const CONFIG = {
  webhookUrl: 'https://services.leadconnectorhq.com/hooks/...',
  whatsappNumber: '447700173390',
  phoneNumber: '07700 173390',
  email: 'info@skintight.uk',
}
```

### Treatment Pricing

**Consultation-first model:**
- Consultation + First Treatment: £50
- Subsequent sessions: Personalised pricing based on client needs

Michelle assesses each client during the consultation and creates a tailored treatment plan with custom pricing based on their specific goals and skin condition.

## SEO & Tracking

- **Metadata:** `app/layout.tsx` (title, description, OpenGraph, Twitter)
- **Sitemap:** `app/sitemap.ts` (auto-generated)
- **Robots:** `app/robots.ts`
- **Schema:** `components/StructuredData.tsx` (LocalBusiness JSON-LD)
- **Facebook Pixel:** `components/FacebookPixel.tsx`
  - Tracks: PageView, Lead, AssessmentStart, AssessmentComplete

## Deployment

### Vercel (Recommended)

```bash
npm run build   # Test build locally first
vercel          # Deploy
```

### Environment Variables

```
# .env.local (if needed)
NEXT_PUBLIC_FB_PIXEL_ID=your_pixel_id
```
